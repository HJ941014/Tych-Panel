Manual installation
===================

Before installing, make sure any old Tych Panel files have been removed.


Photoshop CS 6 / CC
-------------------

1. Copy the Tych Panel directory, residing in panels/cs6 to 
   <Photoshop CS6>/Plug-ins/Panels.

   Important!

   If you copy the wrong directory (ie CS5 instead of CS6) you will get
   a "Load panel xml error Error #2032" error in Photoshop.

2. Copy the Tych Panel directory (residing in the "scripts" directory) to
   <Photoshop CS6>/Presets/Scripts.

3. Run Photoshop and show the panel by going to Window/Extensions/Tych Panel.


Photoshop CS 5
--------------

The steps are the same for CS5, but you copy from the cs5 directory instead:

1. Copy the Tych Panel directory, residing in panels/cs5 to 
   <Photoshop CS5>/Plug-ins/Panels.

2. Copy the Tych Panel directory (residing in the "scripts" directory) to
   <Photoshop CS5>/Presets/Scripts.

3. Run Photoshop and show the panel by going to Window/Extensions/Tych Panel.


Bridge integration
------------------

1. Copy the file scripts/Tych Panel.jsx to the Bridge Startup scripts directory.

The Bridge Startup scripts directory are located in the following locations:

On Mac OS X:
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Bridge [version]/Startup Scripts/

On Windows:
~\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Bridge [version]\Startup Scripts\
